        - I decided to use the Font Awesome icons. The icons that I chose fit in well with the overall theme of cryptocurrencies. The icons are styled in accordance with my website, with the same colors and font size.

* ## Structure ~


* ## Wireframes

    * I made some basic wireframes using Balsamiq at the beginning of the project, this allowed me to get a brief understadning of how I want Crypto Quiz to look as well as ensuring I have a rough model to follow. I found Balsamiq very helpful and easy to use, I didn't quite know what styling I wanted on my pages however I had a rough idea how I wanted the quiz to look. I knew how many pages I wanted my website to have and how the sections should link to one another. Balsamiq allowed me to create a visual of my idea and gave me a goal to work towards, below my wireframes.
