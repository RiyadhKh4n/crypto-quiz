# User Experience (UX) ~

* ## Vision
   Crypto Quiz is a game which aims to test your knowledge about the world of cryptocurrencies and to engage people who want to learn and get into the space, whether you are a complete beginner or want to expand what you already know. This game will take you through the core concepts of cryptocurrencies and and test everything you have learnt. As someone who is invested in crypto and really believes in the technology behind it, I would have loved to have an interactive game where I could have tested my knowledge so I am doing just that and creating it myself. I want this game to be inclusive and accessible for everyone, I want it to be engaging and to encourage the you into getting involved in the space.

* ## Aims
   To give provide a platform for crypto newbies or experts to test what they know in an all in one game, and to allow them to quickly learn the core concepts of this complex industry giving them the opportunity to make smarter investment decisions, in a fun and interactive way. I want the game to be fun and have re-play value so I will make the questions random each time so you can play and get tested on different aspects of the industry. 

* ## Target Audience
    There are a number of target audiences for this game due to the fact that crypto is for everyone. We welcome new and experienced people from ages, to come and learn adn test their knowledge about this fascinating industry. However, Crypto Quiz is mainly aimed at educating people who know nothing about crypto as it the questions will not be extremly diffuclt and just touch on the main aspects of the indusrty.

        - I decided to use the Font Awesome icons. The icons that I chose fit in well with the overall theme of cryptocurrencies. The icons are styled in accordance with my website, with the same colors and font size.

* ## Structure ~


* ## Wireframes

    * I made some basic wireframes using Balsamiq at the beginning of the project, this allowed me to get a brief understadning of how I want Crypto Quiz to look as well as ensuring I have a rough model to follow. I found Balsamiq very helpful and easy to use, I didn't quite know what styling I wanted on my pages however I had a rough idea how I wanted the quiz to look. I knew how many pages I wanted my website to have and how the sections should link to one another. Balsamiq allowed me to create a visual of my idea and gave me a goal to work towards, below my wireframes.
